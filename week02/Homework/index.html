        The domestic guinea pig plays an important role in folk culture for many indigenous Andean peoples, especially as a food source. It is also used in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies.The animals are used for meat and are a culinary staple in the Andes Mountains, where they are known as cuy. Biological experimentation on domestic guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th century. The animals were used so frequently as model organisms in the 19th and 20th centuries that the epithet guinea pig came into use to describe a human test subject.

        No natural population of this species exists in the wild. Guinea pigs were apparently domesticated more than 3,000 years ago in Peru, coinciding with humans’ transition from a nomadic to an agricultural lifestyle. The Incas kept guinea pigs, and the animals were bred during the same period by various people who lived along the Andes Mountains from northwestern Venezuela to central Chile. These rodents remain a sustainable food source for the native peoples of Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, who either keep them in their homes or allow them to scavenge freely both indoors and out.

        The origin of the colloquial name guinea pig is a subject of much debate. The first part of the name may have been derived from the price of the animal in 16th- and 17th-century England—that is, possibly one guinea—or it may have arisen from the animals’ being carried to European markets after first being transferred to ships in ports in Guinea. The moniker could also have originated with a mispronounced form of the word Guiana, the name of the region where some guinea pigs were collected - It is also know that the Guinea Pig is some type of dog or something.
