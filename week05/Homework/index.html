                    Kehinde Wiley is a young, African-American painter  who  is  quite  literally  changing  the  face(s)   of   portraiture   with   his   sensitive,   vibrant, and political portrayals of black folk, ranging  from  teenagers  he  meets  on  the  streets,  to  fellow  contemporary  artists,  and  even    former    President    Barack    Obama.Wiley made a name for himself for his natu-ralistic,  brightly  colored  portraits  of  young  black men, often with dramatic flowery back-grounds.    With    black    masculinity    often  framed  as  synonymous  with  fear  and  violence  in  the  USA,  his  generous  and  vibrant  portraits  challenge  viewers'  precon-ceptions  of  their  subjects  and bring young men, and people,  of  color  into  the  galleries   and   museums   where  they  are  sounder-represented  as  from  within.Wiley's  work  falls  into  the  category  of  Identity  Politics, which  is  art,  film,  and writing,    which     deals     primarily    with    aspects  of  the  artist's  identity,  for  exam-ple race, gender, and sexuality. It is vitally important   to   Wiley   that   black   people,   especially black American men, are both the  subjects  and  the  audience  of  his  most  popular  and  requested  paintings.At  a  time  when  young  black  men  are  constantly vilified in the press and main-stream  media,  and  even  murdered  on  the  street  by  racist  policemen,  Wiley's  portraits  are  an  essential  document  of  the power, fashion, versatility and beauty of   the   black   community   in   the   USA.   Wiley  talks  about  portraiture  and  the  "field of power", referring to the way that painted   portraits   of   people   indicates   that  they  are  powerful,  but  also  that  portraits  hold  the  potential  to  enlight

                <a>Amanita muscaria, commonly known as the fly agaric or fly amanita, is a basidiomycete of the genus Amanita. It is also a muscimol mushroom. Native throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, Amanita muscaria has been unintentionally introduced to many countries in the Southern Hemisphere, generally as a symbiont with pine and birch plantations, and is now a true cosmopolitan species. It associates with various deciduous and coniferous trees.

                    Arguably the most iconic toadstool species, the fly agaric is a large white-gilled, white-spotted, usually red mushroom, and is one of the most recognizable and widely encountered in popular culture.
                    
                    Despite its easily distinguishable features, Amanita muscaria is a fungus with several known variations, or subspecies. These subspecies are slightly different, some have yellow or white caps, but they are all usually called fly agarics, and they are most of the time recognizable by their notable white spots. Recent DNA fungi research, however, has shown that some of these variations are not muscarias at all, such as peach-colored fly agaric for example, but the common name 'fly agaric' clings on. </a>

                <a>Amanita muscaria varies considerably in its morphology, and many authorities recognize several subspecies or varieties within the species. In The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy, German mycologist Rolf Singer listed three subspecies, though without description: A. muscaria ssp. muscaria, A. muscaria ssp. americana, and A. muscaria ssp. flavivolvata. However, a 2006 molecular phylogenetic study of different regional populations of A. muscaria by mycologist JÃ³zsef Geml and colleagues found three distinct clades within this species representing, roughly, Eurasian, Eurasian "subalpine", and North American populations.</a>

                <a>A large, conspicuous mushroom, Amanita muscaria is generally common and numerous where it grows, and is often found in groups with basidiocarps in all stages of development. Fly agaric fruiting bodies emerge from the soil looking like white eggs. After emerging from the ground, the cap is covered with numerous small white to yellow pyramid-shaped warts. These are remnants of the universal veil, a membrane that encloses the entire mushroom when it is still very young. Dissecting the mushroom at this stage reveals a characteristic yellowish layer of skin under the veil, which helps identification.</a>
